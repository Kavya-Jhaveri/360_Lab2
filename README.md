Lab Practice 2: Position Control and Dynamics

Due: Thursday, February 8, 2024, 11:59 PM
Objective: We will acquire knowledge and practical skills in developing a position controller, understanding the basics of translational dynamics, and mastering the techniques to counteract gravitational effects.

Download the last version of the book.

Part 1: Position control

Solve Exercise 5 of Chapter 2.
Solve Exercise 6 of Chapter 2.


Part 2: Learning to fly

Write a simulator that includes translational dynamics to simulate free fall (Section 3.3 of the book). Use this code as a guideline.
Include a buoyancy force of fb=9.0 in the simulator. How does it compare with the free fall? Which one falls faster?  (Exercise 1 of Chapter 3).
Write a height controller that compensates for gravity using a PD controller (Exercise 2 of Chapter 3).
Solve Excercise 3 of Chapter 3
